## 📁 About This Repository

This repository contains mini projects and practice apps I’ve created during my journey to master web development. These projects are focused on:

- ✅ Strengthening core concepts (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- ✅ Practicing DOM manipulation and UI design
- ✅ Building real-world components and apps
- ✅ Applying best practices and clean code

Every project is simple, standalone, and easy to understand — perfect for beginners or anyone looking to brush up on fundamentals.
